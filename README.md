Dotfiles
========
This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles.  They should be cloned to
your home directory so that the path is `~/git/dotfiles/`.  The included setup
script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located
in `~/git/dotfiles/`.

The install script will create symlinks to the dotfiles in `~/git/dotfiles/`
in your home directory

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/escott55/dotfiles ~/git/dotfiles
cd ~/git/dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
```
